Pipelines can be launched using an existing workspace pipeline name from the Launchpad, or from source as described above.

For example, launching a pipeline you added in the previous step:

```
launch:
  - name: 'rnaseq-test-cli'
    pipeline: 'nf-core-rnaseq'
    workspace: # required
    params: # optional
      outdir: 's3://my-bucket/nf-core-rnaseq/results'
```
